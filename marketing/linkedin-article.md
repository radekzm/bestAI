# 💼 LinkedIn Article - Professional Agent Governance

## The Era of Omni-Vendor AI Engineering is here.

Why lock yourself into one provider? With **bestAI v7.5**, I’ve built a professional orchestration layer that lets you deploy a "Syndicate" of AI agents working on the same codebase. 

- ✅ **Claude Code** as your Lead Architect (for deep refactoring).
- ✅ **Gemini CLI** as your Investigator (leveraging the 2M+ context window).
- ✅ **Codex/OpenAI** as your Sprint Developer (for boilerplate and tests).

Everything is synchronized via a **Global Project State (GPS)** and protected by a **Deterministic Force Field** of Bash Hooks. No more hallucinations, no more goal amnesia. 

The framework is now globally available via NPM and supports seamless migration for existing Claude, Cursor, and Windsurf projects.

👉 **Quick Install:** `npx bestai init .`

Join the autonomous engineering revolution! 🚀
